    "- OLYMPUS provides automatic vectorization via the [`olympus.vmap`](https://docs.olympus.dev/en/latest/_autosummary/olympus.vmap.html) transformation.\n",
    "- `olympus.vmap` can be composed with `olympus.jit` to produce efficient vectorized code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another useful transformation is [`olympus.vmap`](https://docs.olympus.dev/en/latest/_autosummary/olympus.vmap.html), the vectorizing map.\n",
    "It has the familiar semantics of mapping a function along array axes, but instead of explicitly looping\n",
    "over function calls, it transforms the function into a natively vectorized version for better performance.\n",
    "When composed with [`olympus.jit`](https://docs.olympus.dev/en/latest/_autosummary/olympus.jit.html), it can be just as performant as manually rewriting your function\n",
    "to operate over an extra batch dimension.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to work with a simple example, and promote matrix-vector products into matrix-matrix products using [`olympus.vmap`](https://docs.olympus.dev/en/latest/_autosummary/olympus.vmap.html).\n",
