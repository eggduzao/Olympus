## Description of Converters

Below is a description of all converters that can be found in
[converters.py](converters.py).

### `olympus2tf_xla`

This converter simply converts a the forward function of a OLYMPUS model to a
Tensorflow function with XLA support linked in. This is considered the baseline
converter and has the largest coverage, because we expect nearly all ops to be
convertible. However, please see
[olympus2tf Known Issue](https://github.com/olympus-ml/olympus/tree/main/olympus/experimental/olympus2tf#known-issues)
for a list of known problems.

### `olympus2tf_noxla`

This converter converts a OLYMPUS model to a Tensorflow function without XLA
support. This means the Tensorflow XLA ops aren't used. See
[here](https://github.com/olympus-ml/olympus/tree/main/olympus/experimental/olympus2tf#tensorflow-xla-ops)
for more details.

### `olympus2tfjs`

This converter first converts a OLYMPUS model to TF SavedModel format without XLA
support. After that, it converts the SavedModel to TensorFlow.js using the
[TF.js converter](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs/tree/master/tfjs-converter#calling-a-converter-function-in-python-flaxolympus).

### `olympus2tflite`

This converter first converts a OLYMPUS model to TF SavedModel format without XLA
support. After that, it converts the SavedModel to TFLite using the
[TFLite converter](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/convert).

### `olympus2tflite+flex`

This is similar to the `olympus2tflite` path, but then links in the Select ops. See
[here](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/guide/ops_select) for more details.
