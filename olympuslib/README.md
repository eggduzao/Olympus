# olympuslib: support library for OLYMPUS

olympuslib is the support library for OLYMPUS. While OLYMPUS itself is a pure Python package,
olympuslib contains the binary (C/C++) parts of the library, including Python bindings,
the XLA compiler, the PJRT runtime, and a handful of handwritten kernels.
For more information, including installation and build instructions, refer to main
OLYMPUS README: https://github.com/olympus-ml/olympus/.
